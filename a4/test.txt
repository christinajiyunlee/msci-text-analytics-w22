My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.
She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.
I was hoping there were more where those came from.
This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however.
I should have sent it bk., but I factored in the cost of return shipping - wasn't worth the return.
It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.
The only thing it has going for it is portability.
It can only hold regular sized hard covered books.
Forget about any size paperback, it will not work.
Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.
I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.
For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand.
The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes.
For fruit pop recipes, "Top Pops" by Emily Zaiden is far better.
This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend).
There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy.
The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too.
They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty.
The quality of the product is low, the paint is uneven and the bottom of the cup is cheeped.
Neither of them are true &#34;teaspoon&#34; size spoons.
The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power (even for a butter knife) behind it.
HOWEVER, for the price I paid, I can't expect anything else.
They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil, this isn't the one you want.
Also look carefully at the fork and knife, they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.
The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.
