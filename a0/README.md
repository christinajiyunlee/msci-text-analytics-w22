## Assignment 0

I confirm that I have installed keras, NumPy, sklearn and genism in a virtual environment for this assignment.

### The following procedure was used

1. Create the virtual environment that I named "venv"
`python -m venv venv`
2. Activate venv
`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install packages `pip install PACKAGE_NAME`
